Pre-built Binaries
==================

This directory contains pre-built binaries for the parts that are not yet
included in the open source release and to help you get started with BinNavi
right away.
``binnavi-all.jar`` is provided for convenience, just run with this command:
    java -jar binnavi-all.jar

The file ``binnavi600-win-x86.msi`` is the full Windows installer package for
a slightly outdated version of BinNavi, but which should work out of the box.
